			<h1 style=font-size:30px>About Me</h1>
			<p>Some curiosities about me are that I love being outdoors, going hiking, and camping, also I used to have a motorcycle and is something that I like a lot. I am from Brazil and I consider myself a very friendly and easy-going person. I like to work in a team where people help each other and where I feel that I can help too. I love seeing my work being useful to other people. I'm usually very proactive and a good communicator, I have experienced working in different types of teams in one thing in common that people should always pay attention to is being more communicative.</p>
