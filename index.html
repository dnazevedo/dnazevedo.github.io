			<h1 style=font-size:30px>Hello, World. I'm Daiane.</h1>
			<p>I'm Daiane, from Brazil, currently living in Canada, studying Computer Programming at Fanshawe
				College as my third specialization in the IT industry. I'm a
				backend software developer with over four years of experience between internships and full-time jobs. I've
				mostly worked at fintechs and I've gotten familiar with many of the business processes and technical
				challenges that the payment market brings. I have experience with object-orientation, functional
				programming, and languages such as C#, Clojure, and Typescript. The teams I've worked with always used
				agile methodologies (variations of Scrum), and I strongly believe that having a team that knows how to work
				well together is essential for the success of the project and the company.</p>
